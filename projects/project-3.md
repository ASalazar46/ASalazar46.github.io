As apart of the engineering curriculum, all engineering students are required to undergo a series of projects through out their sophomore, junior, and senior years here at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. These projects are labeled as EE/ENGR 296, 396, and 496, respectively. For this project, EE396 and EE496, the goal is to convert the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus into a 100% renewable energy campus.

I was assigned the role of dashboard member. My objectives as this role is to develop the front-end software of the project. This means that my groups handles how data retrieved from data-collecting devices is displayed, create graphs and charts from such data, and maintain the project website.
