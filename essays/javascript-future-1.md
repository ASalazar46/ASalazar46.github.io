## So. What do you think about Javascript so far? If youâ€™re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?
My exposure to Javascipt was limited to hearing about it from classmates who have taken the respective course for it. According to them, Javascript is easy to learn. I took their testimonials with a grain of salt because everyone learns things at their own pace. However, after taking the first two sections (Basic Javascript and ES6) of the Javascipt course on learn.freecodecamp.org, I can confirm that the basics are easy enough but the ES6 took a bit of head grease to work with it. As a complete noob, the basics of Javascipt are very similar to C/C++ and Java. For example, in C, variable declarations must include a variable type and a name for the variable (i.e int x = 2). In Javascript, variables declarations include either the keywords "var" or "let" and a name (i.e var x = 2 or let x = 2). In Javascipt, it seems like the variable's type is determined by its value.

## What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?
