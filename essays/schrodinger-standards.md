## What do you mean "Schrodinger's Coding Standards?"
To understand where this reflection is going, I must first describe the analogy to Schrodinger's cat. This concept is probably one of the only things I remember from my modern physics course. Basically, Schrodinger had a cat, and he conducted a thought experiment on it (not an actual experiment). In this thought experiment, he enclosed a cat in a box along with a radioactive atom that could kill the cat. He then came up with idea that as long as he did not open the box, then the cat would be both alive and dead simultaneously. 

## So...
This idea of being in two opposite states at the same time can be applied to the coding standards that I follow when programming in Javascript. Written code to coding standards is like Schrodinger's cat to Schrodinger. It does not matter if I write quality Javascript code, if the code does not follow a standard, then it is both good and bad at the same time. I want to avoid bad code, so following a coding standard is the best thing I can do to achieve this. 

## Well, what are you doing to make it happen?
First, I need a program that supports programming in Javascript. I use IntelliJ Idea as my go-to programming space.
