## "Why do my feet smell if they don't have a nose?"
Perhaps one of the first important lessons that a student could learn in elementary school is that there are no such things as bad or dumb questions. This is true, to some degree. All questions are good inherently, but the perceived status of the question, be it good or bad, depends on the overall context. Take the heading question of this paragraph, "Why do my feet smell if they don't have a nose?" If you were to ask this question to children or comedians, then it is likely that they would respond with their answer and say that this question is a good question. However, to the serious-minded adult or people who don't understand jokes, then this question is the perfect example of a bad question. In this essence, let us apply this logic to the REAL questions. Specifically, questions that we ask online for our programming needs. What kind of context determines if a technical question is perceived as good or bad? 

## The Good, The Bad, and The Technical
We will be referencing the article, "How to Ask Questions the Smart Way" by Eric Steven Raymond, to determine what makes a good technical question and what makes a bad question. In Raymond's eyes, one way a question is good is when the question is unique. This means that, before asking, the question remains unanswered, even after searching the very last pages of a google search, reading any necessary documentations or manuals, or when your parents are just as stumped as you. Another way a question is good is when it describes the process, problems, and tools involved that led to the asking of the question. One final way a question is good is that it reads good. No spelling or grammatical errors, precise, and it does not sound like the asker is in desperate need of an answer. Take a look at this question on StackOverflow: 
<insert image of good question here>
Notice how this question embodies the specified qualities of a good question? Coincidence? I think not. Now take a look at this question:
<insert image of bad question here>
Notice how this question is the opposite of the good question qualities?
