## 1  Introduction
The purpose of this paper is to “explore lifelong learning, and in particular as it pertains to the professional development of a computer or electrical engineer.  Lifelong learning is important to everyone but especially to professionals in the technology fields, which change rapidly over time.  It is important for an engineer, who may have a career spanning three or four decades, to continually learn and develop.  This is especially so because it is quite common for an engineer’s professional role to change over time from say design engineer to management or sales [1].” This paper is split into four sections. The first section is the introduction, which describes the purpose and organization of this paper. The second section describes what lifelong learning is and what it means to an aspiring computer engineer or electrical engineer. The third section answers why lifelong learning is important. The final section is the conclusion, where all the contents of this paper are briefly summed up. 

## 2  What is Lifelong Learning?
As the name suggests, lifelong learning is the process of learning throughout life. Informally, it is “the provision or use of both formal and informal learning opportunities throughout people's lives in order to foster the continuous development and improvement of the knowledge and skills needed for employment and personal fulfilment [2].” Anyone, especially engineers, can take advantage of lifelong learning in order to better themselves personally and professionally. The potential for a desirable lifestyle or career depends on one’s capacity to learn. By using lifelong learning to acquire numerous skills, traits, and experience one’s potential for a better career increases. Since the scope of learning is only limited to the extent of one’s own life - which is already vast - there are many lifelong learning opportunities for engineers to take.   

## 2.1  Lifelong Learning Opportunities
The first two opportunities for lifelong learning, and possibly the most obvious opportunities, are through formal instruction. The opportunities are grade school (1) (preschool to 12th grade) and college (2) (undergraduate school and graduate school alike). It is no surprise that schools are a place of lifelong opportunity, as they are designed for people of all ages to learn. In 1941, vice-chancellor Sir Richard Livingston [3] argued that “the test of successful education is not the amount of knowledge that pupils take away from school, but their appetite to know and their capacity to learn.” To this day many people echo this sentiment [4], which shows just how opportunistic school is for learning. I can say the same, as I have gone through grade school and currently in my third year, second semester of undergraduate study. Simply attending classes and getting involved with school-related assignments and projects are enough to say that I have been practicing this method of lifelong learning for a quite a bit of time. This is a good thing because most potential careers or jobs will, extremely likely, require some form of education level, like owning a high school diploma or a college degree. Having these levels of education (or better) shows employers that I have the capacity to learn, which is an enticing trait for potential employees to have. 

Another lifelong learning opportunity are professional societies (3). For electrical or computer engineers, one could consider joining the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (commonly referred to as IEEE). Their purpose is to, “foster technological innovation and excellence for the better of humanity [5].” For this reason and all the work that has gone to making this mission complete, IEEE has grown to the professional society that it is today. To an engineer, being apart of IEEE shows employers that one shares the same passion and initiative. By joining, I greatly impress employers and increase my odds of landing desirable advances in my engineering career. For me, I can start by reviewing the membership application for students. 

While IEEE and professional societies are definitely excellent opportunities for lifelong learning, sometimes the best opportunities are those that are personally close to me and just as effective as any professional society: my parents (4). Having lived a life for much longer than I have ever been alive, it is safe to say that my parents are packed full of wisdom, experience, and bad jokes [6]. From the day I could speak and understand words on a deeper level, I started the lifelong process that is lifelong learning. From my parents came the knowledge that created the foundations for professional behavior in the job market. The job market is always looking for professionals (or people who have the potential to be professional), and the first step to getting hired is to act professional. Regarding people as opportunities of lifelong learning, it is not just limited to my parents. People with an engineering background, or people who can help shape me up for the engineering workforce are potential opportunities for lifelong learning (5). What one person may have experienced throughout their lifelong learning journey could be shared with me, making me all the more wiser. It is also the reverse: I can share what I have learned to them, making them all the more wiser. In the case where employers are looking for the experienced, I get slightly closer to meeting that requirement with every piece of information people share with me. 	

In addition to people and schools as lifelong learning opportunities, there are also media sources that serve the same purpose. One such opportunity of lifelong learning is exploring the internet (6)[7]. The internet is full of information on almost everything, and I have been using the internet to search for all the things I need and want to know. This build-up of information is beneficial to me because the more things I know, the more I can apply those things to solve problems, which defines a part of what it means to be a good engineer. In addition to the internet, there are books (7), scholarly articles (8), Youtube videos (9), and classes (10), all of which can discuss specific categories of information, especially engineering-related topics [8].

## 3  The Importance of Lifelong Learning  
One reason why lifelong learning is important is because it allows people to adapt to rapidly advancing technology. On June 27-28, 1996, the National Academy of Engineering committee presented a speech to the engineering community about the challenges engineers have brought up to them. According to NAE chair Ernest Smerdon, “Technology is rushing headlong into the future at a pace that takes one's breath away. Personal computers, the Internet, genetic engineering, advanced materials, new forms of chemical synthesis--all these things and more are changing our world swiftly, profoundly, and, in most cases, for the better. But the excitement and the progress come at a cost. Rapid change is not always comfortable, and no one knows this better than the people whose job it is to stoke the technological juggernaut [9].” To prove this, he also provides a study that illuminates how rapidly technology is evolving. In this study, the half-life (the amount of time it takes for half an engineer’s knowledge becomes obsolete) of an engineer’s technicals skills were calculated. For mechanical engineers, it is 7.5 years. For electrical engineers, 5 years. For software engineers, 2.5 years. He addresses this issue later on in the article, “The key, the experts say, is having engineers who are constantly learning, constantly upgrading their skills, constantly adapting to new situations. Some refer to this as "technical vitality," others prefer to speak of "career-long education," but the terminology is not important. What is important is that engineers treat their careers as dynamic things which need continuous upkeep and upgrading. And this demands a new way of thinking from engineers and their employers--a culture shift to match the changing technological environment [9].”

Another reason why lifelong learning is important is because companies needs more workers with a lifelong learning way of thinking. According to this scholarly article [10], due to the increased life expectancy and increased retirement age, there are more older generations working than younger generations. Younger generations have already began to adopt lifelong learning methods, so the labor of the younger generations are invaluable. However, since there are more older generations working that have seldom thought about lifelong learning, it makes sense for them to start thinking about lifelong learning.  Should everyone start to participate in lifelong learning, everyone becomes a useful asset to their jobs/careers, which benefits both the company and its workers. 

One final reason why reason why lifelong learning is important is because this way of thinking has the potential to improve one’s worth in their own personal lives. There are benefits to those who are capable of lifelong learning. In a study conducted by the Pew Research Center [11], 2752 americans across the United States were surveyed about topics related to lifelong learning. In particular, one part of the survey included a topic on the benefits of lifelong learning on their personal lives. From the 2752 subjects, 87% said that they considered themselves as personal learners, and their activities helped them feel more capable and well rounded. 69% of the subjects also said that their learning opened up new perspectives about their lives. 64% said that their learning has helped them make new friends. 58% said it made them feel more connected to their local community. 43% said it prompted them to get more involved in volunteer opportunities. In addition to improved personal worth, lifelong learning also has the potential to improve one’s value in the workforce. In the same study [11], 65% said their learning in the past 12 months expanded their professional network. 47% said their extra training helped them advance within their current company. 29% said it enabled them to find a new job with their current employer or a new one. 27% said it helped them consider a different career path. That being said, those who engage in lifelong learning for professional-improvement reasons are more likely to earn a higher income. Those who engage in lifelong learning for personal-improvement are more likely to have improved attitudes regarding new information, and are more likely to seek out more opportunities to grow as a person. 

## 4  Conclusion
The purpose of this paper is to define what lifelong learning is, discuss the opportunities that lifelong learning provides to a person, and illuminate why lifelong learning is important. Presented in this paper are 10 opportunities for lifelong learning, going into detail as to how I have participated in said opportunities and how they benefit me. These opportunities are grouped into four categories: formal instruction, professional societies, formal and informal human interaction, and media sources. Also presented in this paper are three reasons why lifelong learning is important. The first reason is that it allows people to adapt to rapidly advancing technology. The second reason is because the workforce needs more people who are capable of lifelong learning. The final reason is because it provides benefits that ultimately improves one’s personal and professional lives.
